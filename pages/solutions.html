            <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Today’s older generations – despite having adequate information – failed to stem climate change or set the planet on a course to avoid growing climate disasters. And they tied one arm of young people behind their back by supporting only renewable energies as an alternative to fossil fuels. Now, as it has become clear that climate is driving hard toward the Point of No Return, there are efforts to tie the other arm of young people behind their back. We refer to efforts to prohibit actions that may be needed to affect Earth’s energy balance, temporarily, while the difficult task of reducing greenhouse gases is pursued as rapidly as practical – namely Solar Radiation Modification (SRM). Purposeful global cooling with such climate interventions is falsely described as “geoengineering,” while, in fact, it is action to reduce geoengineering. Humanmade climate forcings are already geoengineering the planet at an unprecedented, dangerous, rate.</p>
            <p>Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These clean energy sources are abundant and sustainable.</p>
       
            <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p>Improving energy efficiency in buildings, industries, and transportation can significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Simple steps like using energy-efficient appliances and insulation can make a big difference.</p>
        <p>There is no expectation of purposeful global cooling in the near-term. For now, what is needed is a strengthened resolve to transition away from fossil fuels and adequate funding to assist nations presently suffering climate disasters. Countries most responsible for climate change will be expected to provide funding. Recognition of a growing obligation may encourage phasedown of relevant emissions. These issues are complex, but now unavoidable.</p>
