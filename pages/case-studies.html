                <h2>Case Study 1: The Paris Agreement</h2>
                <p>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a legally binding international treaty aimed at combating climate change. The agreement's central goal is to limit global warming to below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, with efforts to keep it below 1.5°C. This agreement brought together 195 countries to collectively address the challenges posed by climate change. It established nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which outline the actions each country will take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                <p>One of the critical successes of the Paris Agreement is the global commitment to reducing carbon emissions, which has led to major strides in clean energy investments and climate policies. Countries that are part of the agreement have pledged to decarbonize their economies by shifting to renewable energy sources, reducing fossil fuel dependence, and promoting energy efficiency. This case study demonstrates how international cooperation can lead to impactful and meaningful climate action.</p>

                <h2>Case Study 2: Reforestation in China</h2>
                <p>Over the past several decades, China has implemented large-scale reforestation programs to combat desertification and improve air quality. The country has planted billions of trees to restore degraded land, improve biodiversity, and reduce soil erosion. The goal of these programs is not only to create a buffer against environmental degradation but also to help mitigate the impacts of climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide.</p>
                <p>One of the most notable reforestation projects is the Green Great Wall initiative, which aims to plant trees across 2,800 kilometers of land in northern China. The initiative has significantly reduced the amount of sandstorms in the region and is contributing to the restoration of wildlife habitats. China’s approach to reforestation serves as an example of how large-scale environmental restoration efforts can positively impact both ecosystems and human communities.</p>
